# ASSIGN2

The problem statement will be used to gain project support and approval from stakeholders. As such, it must be action-oriented.[3] More importantly, the problem statement must be written clearly and accurately in order to deliver successful results. A poorly crafted or incorrect problem statement will lead to a faulty solution, as well as wasted time, money, and resources.[1]

There are several basic elements that can be built into every problem statement to decrease the risk of project failure. First, the problem statement must focus on the end user. A common mistake is focusing on how a problem will be solved rather than the current gap. Second, the problem statement should not be too broad. A benefit of using the five whys approach is that it avoids over-simplicity by providing the details needed for understanding the problem and developing an appropriate solution. Finally, the problem statement should not be too narrow. Solution-bias stifles the creativity that arises while brainstorming a solution, which may result in less-than-optimal experience for the user.[8]

It is useful to design and follow a specific format when writing a problem statement. While there are several options for doing this, the following is a simple and straightforward template often used in business analysis to maintain focus on defining the problem.

Ideal: This section is used to describe the desired or "to be" state of the process or product. It identifies the goals of the stakeholders and customers as well as assists in defining scope. At large, this section should illustrate what the expected environment would look like once the solution is implemented.
Reality: This section is used to describe the current or "as is" state of the process or product. It explains pain points expressed by the stakeholders and customers. It should also include the insights and expertise of the project team and subject matter experts provided during problem analysis.
Consequences: This section is used to describe the impacts on the business if the problem is not fixed or improved upon. This includes costs associated with loss of money, time, productivity, competitive advantage, and so forth. The magnitude of these effects will also help determine the priority of the project.
Proposal: This section is used to describe potential solutions. Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been completed, understood, and approved, the project team can start offering options for solving the problem. It can also include suggestions by the stakeholders and customers, although further discussions and research will be needed before a specific course of action can be determined.[7]
Following this format will result in a workable document that can be used by all parties to understand the problem and elicit requirements that will lead to a winning solution.

Example
Problem statements can vary in length, depending on the complexity of the problem. The following is an example of a simple problem statement for the creation of a single sign-on capability:

Ideal:

Ideally, users would be able to sign into their laptops and then automatically have access to all of the applications they need to use.
Reality:

In reality, at least three applications are used every day to accomplish the work. Each application is protected by a password with different requirements for username and password length. Passwords also expire at different times.
Consequences:

Users waste approximately two minutes per day logging into multiple applications (if there are 500 users, then 500 users * 2 minutes per day = 1000 minutes in lost productivity; 1000 minutes = 16.67 hrs per day * $75/hr = $1250 per day).
Help desk resolves approximately 6,000 calls per year to reset forgotten passwords and unlock accounts.
Security risk as users will continue to write usernames and passwords on sticky notes on their desks
Proposal:

Have a software developer, network administration and business stakeholders collaboration to evaluate potential solutions for a single-sign on capability.
